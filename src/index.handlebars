  <h1>Hi. I'm Bryan.</h1>
  <div class="about">
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        I'm a staff frontend platform engineer at <a href="https://speakeasy.com/">Speakeasy</a>
        and a former leader of the Node.js project. I love public speaking and
        engaging with the broader tech community. I also do a lot of LED art and am starting to learn game development.
        Oh, and this one time, I got a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Good times.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am deeply passionate about building inclusive and welcoming technical
        teams and communities. Learning how we can improve ourselves and grow
        is a driving force in my life. Exploring how my bisexuality informs my
        life has been a long, sometimes painful, and deeply meaningful journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech I'm a photographer, passionate gamer since the 1980s, pianist, occasional composer, and wine aficionado.
        I currently live in Oakland with my amazing partner Mel.
      </p>
      <p>I go by <a href="https://twitter.com/nebrius">@nebrius</a> online, and purple is my favorite color.</p>
